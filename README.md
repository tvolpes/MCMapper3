# MCMapper3
Third iteration of a Minecraft mapping program

By Timothy Volpe (C) 2016

The final version of this program is intended to convert Minecraft save files into image tiles that can be used by the Google Maps API

Will also have support for modded blocks

## Build Instructions

1. Built with Visual Studio 2015
2. Requires boost 1.59 with zlib (used 1.2.8)
3. Requires libpng (used 1.6.21)
4. May have to play around with the include and library directories to point to where your boost and libpng are stored
